# Lambda Calculus in React

## Why?

Because it seemed like fun.

Check out [https://thoughtbyte.github.io/lambda-calculus-in-react](https://thoughtbyte.github.io/lambda-calculus-in-react) for a mixture of an introduction to Lambda Calculus and how these React components work.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
